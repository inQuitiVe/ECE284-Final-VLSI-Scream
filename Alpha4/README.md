# Alpha 4: Whole Conv. Layer

Implementing Batch Normalization, ReLU, and Max Pooling Layer into our proposed 2-D systolic array. 

## Selling Points
- With these layers, it is able to fully go through the whole VGG16 CNN. 
- It's actually the hardware side of **Alpha 5**
- **Alpha 7** provides a really good structure for doing BN, ReLU, then MPL after 

## Implementation
